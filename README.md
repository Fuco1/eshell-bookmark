# eshell-bookmark

Simple package integrating eshell with bookmark.el.

# Installation

Get it from MELPA or MELPA Stable with `M-x package-install eshell-bookmark`.

# Usage

You don't have to do anything, simply install the package.  Then use the bookmark features as usual:

* capture a bookmark to eshell with `C-x r m`
* restore an eshell with `C-x r l`

Works with remote/TRAMP hosts as well, which is super cool.
